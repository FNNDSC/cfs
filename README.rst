The ChRIS File System (apps and shell). This repo is a simple thought experiment in code to explore possible ideas for a next generation ChRIS file/data paradigm.

Key areas

* Remove the WORM (Write Once Read Many), or more accurately WOCOM (Write Once Copy Many) nature of the current system.

* Improve File handling speed

* Enable a directory- (and file-) first metaphor on the backend -- at least from a client perspective

* Unify the file APIs that currently exist.
